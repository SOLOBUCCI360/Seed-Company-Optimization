  <h1>Project Case Study: Streamlining Inventory and Order Management at ECO BASIC SEED, Kaduna, Nigeria</h1>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    ECO BASIC SEED, a large-scale agricultural company based in Kaduna, Nigeria, faced two major challenges:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inefficient Data and Inventory Management:</strong> Multiple departments were using Excel, which led to redundant data entry and confusion. There was no unified platform for real-time access to inventory and order data.</li>
    <li><strong>Discrepancies in Customer Order Forecasting:</strong> Customers made large orders (Eg 1 Ton of seeds) months in advance, but when they came to collect, they only bought a fraction (Eg 10Kg) of their order. This caused the farm to overproduce, leading to financial losses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>The goal was to implement an integrated system to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Streamline Inventory Management:</strong> Centralize data input across departments to improve accuracy and accessibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimize Customer Order Forecasting:</strong> Ensure better alignment between customer forecasts and actual purchases, reducing overproduction and loss.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Approach/Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Evaluated existing Excel-based processes and identified inefficiencies in data management and order forecasting at ECO BASIC SEED.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets and Forms Implementation:</strong> Replaced Excel with Google Sheets for live, real-time updates and Google Forms for standardized data entry across departments.</li>
    <li><strong>Centralized Database:</strong> Aggregated all data into one central sheet, ensuring real-time visibility for the warehouse, commercial, and production teams.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment-Based Order System:</strong> Introduced a payment model where customers had to pay upfront for a portion of their order. For instance if you need 3 tons of seed you paid in advance for 2 tons, if you later wanted more  than 2 tons you add the required cost for that, but the customer never ordered less than they paid for after this system, ensuring commitment and reducing the risk of unsold products.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing and Rollout:</strong> Conducted training sessions and tested the system before a full rollout, ensuring smooth adoption across departments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> Employees were initially hesitant to switch from Excel to Google Sheets.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Conducted training sessions and highlighted the efficiency and accuracy of real-time data.</li>

    <li><strong>Data Entry Inconsistencies:</strong> Some employees continued entering data manually instead of using Google Forms.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Introduced monitoring processes and regular check-ins to ensure consistency.</li>

    <li><strong>Integration of Departmental Data:</strong> Different departments had their own systems for tracking data.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Created customized templates for each department that fed into a unified database.</li>

    <li><strong>Customer Order Forecasting:</strong> Predicting demand was difficult due to order changes.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Introduced a payment-based system that tied production to committed payments.</li>

    <li><strong>System Scalability:</strong> As operations grew, high data volume slowed down performance.<br>
    <em>Solution:</em> Implemented data validation and automated reporting for smoother operations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results/Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Data Accuracy:</strong> Real-time data entry reduced errors across departments.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Savings:</strong> The new payment system minimized overproduction and reduced losses.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Demand Forecasting:</strong> Production was more closely aligned with actual customer needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Teams accessed and shared data quickly, improving workflow.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system accommodated future growth with minimal technical overhead.</li>
  </ul>
