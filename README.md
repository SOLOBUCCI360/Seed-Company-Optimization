Project Title: Streamlining Inventory & Order Management for ECO BASIC SEED

Overview:
This project involved designing and implementing a centralized data management system to solve critical operational challenges at ECO BASIC SEED, a large-scale agricultural company in Kaduna, Nigeria.

The Problem:
The company suffered from inefficient, siloed data processes using Excel, leading to inventory confusion and significant financial losses due to unreliable customer order forecasts. Customers would place large advance orders but only collect a fraction, causing massive overproduction.

The Solution:
I led the implementation of an integrated system using Google Workspace (Sheets and Forms) to create a single source of truth for all departmental data. A key innovation was introducing a payment-based order system that required customers to pre-pay for a significant portion of their order, directly tying production to financial commitment and eliminating forecasting guesswork.

Key Results:

Improved Data Accuracy: Eliminated redundant entry and errors with real-time, centralized data.

Financial Savings: Drastically reduced overproduction and losses.

Operational Efficiency: Enabled seamless data sharing and workflow across warehouse, commercial, and production teams.

Scalable System: Built a solution that could grow with the company with minimal overhead.
